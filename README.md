This project is a variation of the [pondlife](https://github.com/WebOrigami/pondlife) sample blog. That blog is written in the Origami language; this project here accomplishes the same result in JavaScript.

To the extent possible, this uses the Origami project's [async-tree](https://weborigami.org/async-tree/) library to create and manipulate the blog content using asynchronous trees.
